The following is from the original repro
Helios-NG
=========

This is a project for breathing new live in Helios, an OS from the 90's.
Helios was developed by the (now defunct) company called Perihelion Ltd., 
mainly targeting the INMOS Transputer but later adding other CPUs like
the ARM series or TMS320c4x DSPs when INMOS' decline became clear.

#####Legal?

I got the permission from Perhelions fromer CEO Tim King and main 
programmer Nick Garnett to "[...] do whatever you want with the Helios sources."
So here we are: "Helios Next Generation" or Helios-NG for short, put under
GPL v3.

As for "the plan" (yes, there is one!), please check out the main [Helios-NG page](http://www.geekdot.com/helios-ng)
